# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started with the lessons a freeCodeCamp. I finished the HTML and some of the CSS lessons

**Thoughts:** Even though it was basic stuff, it was a nice refresh, plus I learned a few things about CSS.

### Day 2: April 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the CSS lessons, and finished 3/5 Responsive Design projects

**Thoughts**: I really didn't like having to use "raw" CSS to stlyle everything from the ground up. I didn't enjoy the challenges and I did what I had to do to pass the criteria. I should also refresh my knowledge on Bootstrap and watch the Bootstrap 4 Course on the Web developer Bootcamp.
